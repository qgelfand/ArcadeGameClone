===============================


DESCRIPTION:
	This game is the 3rd project of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. The goal of the game is to reach the water without being run over by any bugs.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
	This package should be saved to a local machine and unzipped. Alternatively it may be hosted & run through an internet browser.

HOW TO LOAD THE GAME:
	Simply open "index.html". If hosted, navigate to the website.

GAME RULES:
	The goal of the game is to reach the water without being run over by any bugs.
	Move your character using the up, down, left & right keys.
	The bugs spawn systematically with a random location and speed.
	If you reach the water, you get a point, and if you do that 10 times you win the game.
	If you are hit by a bug, you lose a life and start again.
	Lose all your lives, game over!

ISSUES KNOWN:
	Enemies are not destroyed once they leave the screen, so a lot of enemies are instantiated over the course of the game.
	If you encounter bugs or issues please contact https://github.com/qgelfand.

LICENSE:
	I don't have one; I play by my own rules.
